# Electron vs. Qt Framework Comparison

| **Feature**                  | **Electron**                                                                 | **Qt**                                                                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Programming Language**     | JavaScript, HTML, CSS (web technologies)                                    | C++ (primarily), QML/JavaScript for UI (Qt Quick)                          |
| **Framework Type**           | Web-based (uses Chromium for rendering and Node.js for backend)             | Native (compiles to native code, integrates with OS APIs)                  |
| **Resource Usage**           | Higher (due to embedded Chromium and Node.js, can be memory-intensive)      | Lower (lightweight, optimized for performance)                             |
| **Cross-Platform Support**   | Yes (Windows, macOS, Linux)                                                | Yes (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, embedded systems)                |
| **Performance**              | Moderate (slower startup, higher memory footprint)                         | High (native compilation, efficient for resource-constrained environments) |
| **Development Speed**        | Faster (leverages web development skills, rapid prototyping)                | Slower (requires C++ knowledge, steeper learning curve)                    |
| **Native Integration**       | Limited (via Node.js APIs, less seamless than native frameworks)            | Strong (direct access to OS APIs, native look and feel)                    |
| **GUI Capabilities**         | Web-based UI (flexible, modern, but less native feel)                       | Rich widgets (Qt Widgets) and modern UIs (Qt Quick/QML), native appearance |
| **Build Tools**              | npm, Electron Builder                                                      | qmake, CMake, Qt Creator (IDE)                                             |
| **Licensing**                | MIT License (open-source)                                                  | LGPLv3/GPLv3 (open-source), commercial licenses available                 |
| **Popular Desktop Applications** | - Visual Studio Code<br>- Slack<br>- Discord<br>- Atom<br>- Notion<br>- Spotify<br>- Microsoft Teams<br>- Figma<br>- Postman<br>- Twitch | - Session Desktop<br>- Telegram Desktop<br>- KDE Plasma (Linux DE)<br>- VLC Media Player<br>- Autodesk Maya<br>- VirtualBox<br>- MuseScore |
| **Privacy/Security Focus**   | Moderate (web-based, larger attack surface due to Chromium)                 | High (C++ allows fine-grained control, smaller footprint)                  |

## Notes
- **Electron** is ideal for rapid development with web technologies but has higher resource usage.
- **Qt** is suited for performance-critical and privacy-focused applications like **Session Desktop**.
- **Session Desktop** uses Qt, aligning with its lightweight, secure architecture.
